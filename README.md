# What's EGT?

EGT is short for evolutionary game theory. This project contains parallel infinite-population evolutionary game theory simulations which we used to explore bargaining dynamics in populations with multiple identities and arenas.

You can find our paper [here](https://social-epistemology.com/2019/07/01/bargaining-and-intersectional-disadvantage-reply-to-oconnor-bright-and-bruner-julian-zucker-daniel-rassaby-aja-watkins-rory-smead/). It's a response to [_The Emergence of Intersectional Disadvantage_](https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2018.1555870), which was published in the same journal less than a year before.

Funding for this work was supported by the Rossetti Family Program for the Advancement of Humanities. We would also like to thank Cailin Oâ€™Connor for some helpful feedback in replicating her earlier models.
